    %% Quiz Generation and Room Creation
    A->>S: GET /quizzes/generate
    S->>A: Return quiz with answers
    A->>S: POST /quiz-submissions/{roomId}/quiz
    S->>DB: Store quiz & room data
    S->>A: Return quizId & questions

    %% Players joining and getting questions
    P->>S: GET /quiz-submissions/{roomId}/questions
    S->>P: Return questions (no answers)

    %% Answer submission (one at a time)
    P->>S: POST /quiz-submissions/{roomId}/submissions
    S->>DB: Validate answer & update score
    S->>P: Return submission result

    %% Leaderboard updates
    P->>S: GET /quiz-submissions/{roomId}/leaderboard
    S->>DB: Fetch scores
    S->>P: Return leaderboard data
```

<Steps>
  1. **Generate Quiz** (Admin Only)
     ```http
     GET /api/v1/quizzes/generate
     ```
     Generate a new quiz with specified parameters:
     ```bash
     ?quizTopic=formula%20one&numberOfQuestions=2&language=en&quizType=multiplayer
     ```
     The response includes the quiz structure with questions and answers.

2. **Create Quiz Room** (Admin Only)

   ```http
   POST /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/quiz
   ```

   Create a new quiz room with the generated quiz content. The `roomId` is a unique identifier for the multiplayer session.

   The response includes:

   - `quizId`: Unique identifier for the quiz
   - `questions`: Array of questions with their IDs

3. **Get Quiz Questions** (Players)

   ```http
   GET /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/questions
   ```

   Players retrieve quiz questions without correct answers. Response includes:

   - Quiz title and ID
   - Questions with options (no correct answers)
   - Question IDs for submission

4. **Submit Answers** (One at a time)

   ```http
   POST /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/submissions
   ```

   Players submit answers one at a time, with the time taken to answer:

   ```json
   {
     "questionId": "question-uuid",
     "userAnswer": "selected answer",
     "timeTaken": 3500
   }
   ```

   The server:

   - Validates if the answer is correct
   - Calculates points based on time taken using the formula:
     `points = Math.round((1 - (timeTaken / timeLimit) / 2.2) * 1000)`
   - Adds bonus points for fast answers (under 10% of time limit)
   - Updates the user's total score
   - Returns the calculated score and submission details

5. **View Leaderboard**
   ```http
   GET /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/leaderboard
   ```
   Retrieve the current leaderboard for the quiz room, showing all players' scores and correct answers.

## Scoring Mechanics

The time-based scoring system rewards both accuracy and speed:

1. **Base Formula**: `points = Math.round((1 - (timeTaken / timeLimit) / 2.2) * 1000)`
2. **Fast Answer Bonus**: +50 points for answers under 10% of the time limit
3. **Minimum Points**: All correct answers earn at least 100 points
4. **Incorrect Answers**: 0 points

Each user's total score accumulates as they answer questions, and their submission record is updated rather than creating multiple records.

## Error Handling

The API will return appropriate error codes and messages if:

- The quiz generation parameters are invalid
- The room ID doesn't exist
- The question ID is invalid or doesn't belong to the quiz
- The user is not authorized to access the room
