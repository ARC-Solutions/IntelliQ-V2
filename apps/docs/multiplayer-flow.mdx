<Steps>
  1. **Generate Quiz** (Admin Only)
     ```http
     GET /api/v1/quizzes/generate
     ```
     Generate a new quiz with specified parameters:
     ```bash
     ?quizTopic=formula%20one&numberOfQuestions=2&language=en&quizType=multiplayer
     ```
     The response includes the quiz structure with questions and answers.

2. **Create Quiz Room** (Admin Only)

   ```http
   POST /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/quiz
   ```

   Create a new quiz room with the generated quiz content. The `roomId` is a unique identifier for the multiplayer session.

   The response includes:

   - `quizId`: Unique identifier for the quiz
   - `questions`: Array of questions with their IDs

3. **Get Quiz Questions** (Players)

   ```http
   GET /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/questions
   ```

   Players retrieve quiz questions without correct answers. Response includes:

   - Quiz title and ID
   - Questions with options (no correct answers)
   - Question IDs for submission

4. **Submit Answers**

   ```http
   POST /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/submissions
   ```

   Players submit their answers to the quiz:

   ```json
   {
     "score": 85,
     "answers": [
       {
         "questionId": "question-uuid",
         "userAnswer": "selected answer",
         "correctAnswer": "correct answer"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **View Leaderboard**
   `http
     GET /api/v1/quiz-submissions/{roomId}/leaderboard
     `
   Retrieve the current leaderboard for the quiz room, showing all players' scores.
