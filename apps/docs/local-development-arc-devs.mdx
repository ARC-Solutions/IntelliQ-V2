## Introduction

This guide is for **ARC-Solutions developers** who need to set up their local development environment with **Infisical** for secrets management. If you're not part of ARC-Solutions, refer to the [standard local development guide](/local-development).

Here's the monorepo structure:
```
IntelliQ-V2
|-- apps
|   |-- api
|   |-- dashboard
|   |-- docs
|   |-- presentation
|   `-- web
|-- packages
|   |-- api-types
|   |-- typescript-config
|   `-- ui
```

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARC-Solutions/IntelliQ-V2.git
cd IntelliQ-V2
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm i
```

3. **Set up Infisical for secrets management**:

   a. Install the Infisical CLI globally **(if not already installed)**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g infisical
   ```

   b. Log in to Infisical:
   ```bash
   infisical login
   ```
   You will be prompted to complete the login process in your browser. Open the provided link:
   ```
   https://app.infisical.com/login?callback_port=55279
   ```
   Choose **GitHub** as the login method (you should already have been invited to the Infisical workspace).

4. **Export environment variables**:

   For the API:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   npm run dev
   ```

   For the Dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd apps/dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Configure Git to ignore local changes to sensitive files**:
   <Warning>
   ```bash
   git update-index --skip-worktree apps/api/wrangler.toml
   ```
   </Warning>
   This step is important to prevent accidentally committing your local development configuration changes to the repository.
